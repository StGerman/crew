//! Durable scheduler state.
//!
//! This is a cache of *judgment*, not a system of record. The tracker owns what work exists and
//! the filesystem owns the workspaces; SQLite holds only what cannot be re-derived — attempt
//! counts, quarantine flags, turn budgets. Delete the file and the service degrades to stateless
//! re-polling, which is dumber but still correct. That property is what makes adding a database
//! safe here, where the spec left the retry queue unpersisted (§18.2, listed as an open TODO).

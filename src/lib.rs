//! crewd — a tracker-driven orchestrator for Claude Code agents.
//!
//! Layering follows the Symphony spec's better instincts: a deterministic coordination layer
//! that owns polling, claims, concurrency and retries, sitting above pluggable execution and
//! integration layers. Every external effect is a trait so the scheduler can be tested with
//! fakes, on a fake clock, with no sleeps and no tokens spent.

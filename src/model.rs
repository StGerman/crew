//! Domain model.
//!
//! Deliberate deviations from the Symphony spec, each fixing a defect found in review:
//!
//! * [`Outcome`] replaces "the worker process exited normally, so maybe there is more to do".
//!   The spec re-dispatches on a 1s timer forever; here only [`Outcome::Continue`] re-dispatches.
//! * [`ErrorClass`] is partitioned into retryable and permanent. The spec has no permanent
//!   class, so a template typo retries every 5 minutes for eternity.
//! * [`worktree_key`] hashes the *dispatch id*, not the identifier. The spec hashes the
//!   identifier and only when sanitisation alters it, which does nothing for two distinct
//!   issues that genuinely share an identifier.

//! `Worker` over `claude -p --output-format stream-json`.
//!
//! ## Invocation
//!
//! `-p --output-format stream-json --verbose --permission-mode bypassPermissions`, prompt
//! piped on stdin — never as an argv element, so there is no argv length limit and no shell
//! quoting to get wrong. `--permission-mode bypassPermissions` because there is no human on
//! the other end of a permission prompt in a headless dispatch; a prompt nobody answers just
//! hangs the run until the stall timeout kills it anyway, which is strictly worse than the
//! bypass.
//!
//! Three things confirmed against a real install (`claude 2.1.268`, and the session handling
//! below against `2.1.278`) rather than assumed, because guessing them wrong would have meant a
//! worker that silently never worked:
//!
//! * **There is no `--max-turns` flag.** [`AgentConfig::max_turns_per_session`]'s per-session
//!   turn budget is enforced by this module instead — it counts `assistant` events as they
//!   stream and sends `SIGTERM` once the count reaches the budget, reporting
//!   [`Outcome::Continue`] itself rather than waiting for the CLI to enforce a limit it does
//!   not have.
//! * **`--bare` requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.** An operator authenticated via OAuth (the
//!   default interactive login, and what this project's own dev machine uses) has no such key,
//!   and `--bare` fails outright without one. This worker does not pass `--bare`, so it
//!   inherits whatever hooks, plugins and MCP servers the operator's own `claude` config
//!   already has — worth knowing before dispatching against a machine with heavy global hook
//!   configuration, and worth revisiting once a dedicated API key exists for headless dispatch.
//! * **`--session-id <uuid>` names a conversation and `--resume <id>` continues it**, both
//!   working with the prompt on stdin and with `-p`. That is what lets a continuation pick up
//!   where the last one stopped instead of re-reading the issue from scratch. Three details
//!   decided the shape of [`Session`]: a resumed session is *not* scoped to the directory it
//!   was created in, so a worktree moving underneath it is survivable; an id the CLI no longer
//!   holds is answered with `No conversation found with session ID` and a `result` event
//!   carrying `is_error: true` and no turns at all, rather than a hang — which is the signal
//!   the scheduler degrades on; and `--resume` must always be passed *with* an id, because
//!   bare it opens an interactive picker and there is no human here to answer it.
//!
//! [`AgentConfig::max_turns_per_session`]: crate::config::AgentConfig::max_turns_per_session
//! [`Session`]: crate::worker::Session
//!
//! ## Tracker tools
//!
//! When the scheduler has a broker session for the run, this worker adds `--mcp-config <path>`
//! pointing at the file the broker wrote, and names the resulting tools in the prompt — an
//! agent does not use a tool nobody told it about. The flag goes *last* on the command line on
//! purpose: the CLI declares `--mcp-config <configs...>` as variadic, so anything non-flag
//! following it is swallowed as a second config path. (Found the direct way: passing the prompt
//! as an argument after it made the CLI try to open the prompt text as a file.) The prompt goes
//! on stdin regardless, so nothing needs to follow it.
//!
//! `--strict-mcp-config` is deliberately *not* passed: it would suppress the operator's own MCP
//! servers, and this repo commits a [`.mcp.json`] that gives every dispatched agent
//! rust-analyzer. The broker is added to what the operator configured, not substituted for it.
//!
//! [`.mcp.json`]: https://github.com/StGerman/symphony-cc/blob/master/.mcp.json
//!
//! ## The outcome convention
//!
//! `claude -p`'s own terminal `result` event gives exactly one structural verdict: `is_error`.
//! That is enough to distinguish [`Outcome::Done`] from [`Outcome::Failed`], but this project
//! also needs [`Outcome::Continue`] (real progress, wants another turn) and
//! [`Outcome::Blocked`] (stuck, wants a human) — verdicts the CLI has no concept of. The only
//! channel available is the agent's own final text, so the prompt this worker sends asks the
//! agent to end that text with:
//!
//! ```text
//! SYMPHONY_OUTCOME: continue: <reason>
//! SYMPHONY_OUTCOME: blocked: <reason>
//! ```
//!
//! Absence of either line, with `is_error: false`, means `Done`. This is a text convention and
//! therefore soft — an agent that forgets the marker just reads as `Done`, which is the safe
//! default. A malformed line, a crash mid-stream, or a process that exits without ever
//! producing a `result` event all fall through to `Failed { class: AgentCrash }`: absent an
//! explicit verdict, nothing here infers `Continue` from a clean exit, which is the exact
//! spec defect this whole project exists to not have.
//!
//! ## The transcript
//!
//! [`run_reader`] parses a handful of things out of the stream and drops the rest. Everything
//! it drops — `system`, every tool call the agent made — is what a post-mortem actually wants,
//! so the same loop copies each line verbatim to this run's [`TranscriptWriter`] *before*
//! deciding whether the parser has a use for it. Lines that fail to parse are written too: a
//! stream the parser choked on is the single most interesting one to still have afterwards. See
//! [`crate::transcript`] for the retention bounds and for why the file does not live in the
//! worktree.
//!
//! `rate_limit_event` is the one exception: a rejected one is not a per-run detail but the
//! scheduler's cue that the whole account is throttled, so [`parse_rate_limit_event`] reads it
//! here rather than leaving it for a post-mortem (#37). It is still copied to the transcript
//! like every other line.

//! Per-run transcripts of the agent's raw event stream.
//!
//! The worker parses `stream-json` for a turn count, a verdict and a rejected rate limit
//! (#37), and drops everything else — `system`, every tool call. Those dropped lines are
//! precisely what a post-mortem wants and the parser does not, so once the terminal scrollback
//! is gone a run that went wrong cannot be examined at all. This module is the other half of
//! the reader: every line it sees goes to a file keyed by run id, whether or not the parser had
//! a use for it.
//!
//! Three properties, each closing something that went wrong in practice:
//!
//! * **Unbuffered, one write per line.** The diagnosis this exists to prevent was made by
//!   tailing the daemon's redirected stdout, which was block-buffered and hours behind; reading
//!   a stale tail as live state produced a confident and completely wrong conclusion. A
//!   transcript that is itself block-buffered reproduces that defect exactly, so
//!   [`TranscriptWriter`] holds a bare `File` and issues one `write_all` per line. `tail -f` on
//!   it is live.
//! * **Written outside the worktree.** The obvious home is the run's own workspace, and it is
//!   the wrong one twice over: the worktree is a git checkout the agent runs `git add` in, and
//!   it is deleted when the ticket reaches a terminal state — which would destroy the record at
//!   exactly the moment a reviewer starts looking for it. Transcripts live in their own root,
//!   which nothing in [`crate::workspace`] touches.
//! * **Bounded on both axes.** A per-run byte cap and a count of runs kept, because a daemon
//!   that runs for months otherwise fills the disk with the thing that was supposed to make it
//!   debuggable.
//!
//! Best-effort throughout, the same contract [`crate::project`] has: every failure here is
//! logged and swallowed. A transcript that cannot be opened costs a post-mortem, never a
//! dispatch.

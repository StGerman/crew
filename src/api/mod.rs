//! A small read-mostly HTTP surface, so a running orchestrator can be inspected and nudged
//! without a terminal attached.
//!
//! Four routes, all under `/api/v1`:
//!
//! | Route | Method | Answer |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `/snapshot` | `GET` | the published [`Snapshot`], as JSON |
//! | `/issues/:identifier` | `GET` | one [`Row`], run history included |
//! | `/refresh` | `POST` | the snapshot the forced tick published |
//! | `/unquarantine/:identifier` | `POST` | whether a quarantine was actually cleared |
//!
//! Three properties decide the shape of everything below:
//!
//! * **The snapshot is the whole view.** This type holds a [`watch::Receiver`] and a command
//!   channel, and no `Store` — so an endpoint that wanted state the snapshot does not carry
//!   could not reach it even by accident. That is the same rule that keeps the TUI from
//!   becoming load-bearing, and it cuts the same way: if the API cannot answer something, the
//!   snapshot is incomplete and *that* is the bug to fix. Run history is on [`Row`] for
//!   exactly this reason.
//! * **A slow client cannot delay a tick.** Every connection is served by its own task; the
//!   scheduler is reached only by sending a [`Command`] on an unbounded channel, and it never
//!   waits on this side — its reply goes to a `oneshot` whose receiver may already be gone. A
//!   request that stops mid-header is dropped by [`READ_TIMEOUT`] rather than holding anything
//!   the scheduler needs.
//! * **Loopback unless an operator says otherwise.** The two `POST` routes control agent
//!   execution, so [`bind`] refuses a non-loopback address unless `api.allow_public` is set.
//!
//! There is no framework here on purpose. Four routes, no query parameters, no content
//! negotiation and one response type do not pay for a server stack; `ureq` covers the client
//! side of this crate's HTTP needs and this covers the server side, both deliberately small.
//!
//! The seam this module needs for tests is not a trait: it is the pair of channels above.
//! `tests/api.rs` drives a real `Scheduler` through the same command loop `main` runs, over a
//! real socket, so there is no fake here to drift out of step with the real thing.

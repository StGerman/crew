//! The ops API as MCP tools, for the agent supervising this daemon.
//!
//! `crewctl status` closed the gap between the HTTP API and a person (#24). An agent
//! supervising the daemon — one driving a dogfooding session, a watchdog later — was still on
//! the wrong side of it: it had to spawn the CLI and parse a rendering that reuses `fmt_count`,
//! `fmt_ms` and `Phase::label` precisely so it reads well to a human, and so changes whenever
//! the dashboard does. Every fact it needs is in the published [`Snapshot`]; this is a way to
//! ask for it as data.
//!
//! ## What it is, exactly
//!
//! One tool per HTTP route and nothing else — `snapshot`, `issue`, `refresh`, `unquarantine`,
//! `unblock` — each answering with the same JSON body the corresponding route writes. That is not a
//! resemblance kept up by discipline: every tool runs the *same* [`Api`] method the router
//! runs, and frames the resulting [`Response`] as a tool result instead of an HTTP response. A
//! status below 400 is a plain result; anything else is the same body with `isError: true`, so
//! a supervising agent reads a 404 as "no such issue" rather than as a broken server. New
//! authority is a decision separate from new transport, and this module cannot express one: it
//! holds an `Api`, which holds a `watch::Receiver` and a [`Command`](super::Command) sender and
//! no `Store`, so rule 3 is enforced by the type here as it already is over HTTP.
//!
//! The transport is the broker's hand-rolled server, made generic over
//! [`McpService`](crate::broker::McpService) rather than copied; see
//! [`crate::broker::server`]'s module doc for what that cost.
//!
//! ## The constraint that must survive review
//!
//! **crewd must never hand this server to a dispatched agent.** The broker exists because a
//! worker gets authority scoped to one issue; this is scoped to the whole daemon. A worker that could call
//! `unquarantine` or `unblock` could clear its own quarantine or park and re-dispatch itself, defeating
//! `max_turns_per_issue`, the verdict and `parked_state` in one move — the three independent
//! brakes the invariant table says to keep all of.
//!
//! What the crate controls, it enforces by wiring rather than by a check on the tool:
//!
//! * A worker learns of MCP servers from one file, the `--mcp-config` the broker writes in
//!   [`Broker::open`](crate::broker::Broker::open). That file names the broker's own listener
//!   and nothing else, and no code path hands this type to the broker or the broker's address
//!   to this type. `a_dispatched_worker_is_not_handed_the_ops_tools` reads the file a real
//!   session produces and connects to what it names.
//! * This server binds **its own listener**, never the broker's. A shared listener routed by
//!   path prefix would put the operator tools at the exact `host:port` every worker is handed;
//!   two ports make the separation a property of the address rather than of a string compare.
//!   The path `/ops` is accepted and every other path is refused, so a worker's `/mcp/<token>`
//!   URL pointed here by mistake answers no tools.
//!
//! What the crate cannot control is the operator's own `claude` configuration. The worker
//! deliberately runs without `--strict-mcp-config`, so it inherits the operator's MCP servers
//! (see [`crate::worker::claude`]'s module doc for why) — and local scope does not keep this one
//! out, because a worker's worktree is the same project to Claude Code: a dispatched run on
//! 2026-09-26 listed `crew_ops` connected while it was registered only at local scope. The
//! operator accepted that (2026-09-25): workers run as the same user and are trusted as that
//! user, and these tools add nothing a same-user process cannot already do against the
//! loopback HTTP API that serves the same routes. Withholding them for real would take
//! `--strict-mcp-config` with the worker's servers passed explicitly. Off by default for the same
//! reason the HTTP API is: a daemon must not grow a control plane by being upgraded.
//!
//! ## Exposure
//!
//! `api.mcp_enabled`, or `--mcp <addr>` for one run; loopback unless `api.allow_public` says
//! otherwise, through the same [`resolve_bind`](super::resolve_bind) the HTTP API uses, because
//! the two surfaces carry the same two write actions and one flag should govern both. A bind
//! failure costs this server alone — `main` logs it and schedules on — matching how
//! [`super::bind`] already fails.
//!
//! `allow_public` is what makes the transport's own bounds load-bearing here, and it is the
//! reason they exist: the broker's listener is always loopback and serves a handful of workers,
//! but this one is an address an operator picks, on a server that spends a thread per
//! connection. [`Limits`](crate::broker::server::Limits) is what the HTTP API's `READ_TIMEOUT`
//! is over there — a deadline on a request that has begun and never ends, split from the idle
//! wait so keep-alive still works, plus a cap on connections in flight.
//! `a_client_that_never_finishes_its_request_cannot_hold_a_connection_thread` holds it.

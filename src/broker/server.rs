//! MCP over HTTP, on loopback, hand-rolled.
//!
//! ## Why not `rmcp`
//!
//! The issue proposed the official Rust SDK. It was tried and set aside for two concrete
//! reasons, neither of them stylistic:
//!
//! * `rmcp`'s `transport-streamable-http-server` is a `tower::Service`, not a server. It ships
//!   no listener, so it does not remove the need for an HTTP stack — it adds ~35 crates *and*
//!   still requires axum or hyper on top of them. The dependency footprint for the broker's tools
//!   would roughly double this crate's tree.
//! * It is async, and everything it would sit between is not. [`Tracker`] and
//!   [`TrackerWrites`] are blocking by deliberate choice (see [`crate::tracker::github`]'s note
//!   on `ureq`), and `Scheduler::tick` is a synchronous function. Bridging them would mean a
//!   runtime handle threaded through the broker and `spawn_blocking` around every write, for a
//!   protocol surface of four methods.
//!
//! Four methods is what this actually is: `initialize`, `notifications/initialized`,
//! `tools/list`, `tools/call`. The rest of MCP's streamable-HTTP transport is optional for a
//! server that never initiates a message.
//!
//! [`Tracker`]: crate::tracker::Tracker
//! [`TrackerWrites`]: super::TrackerWrites
//!
//! ## Two servers, one transport
//!
//! The same four methods later had to serve a second, unrelated set of tools: the operator's
//! [ops tools](crate::api::mcp), which answer from the published snapshot rather than writing to
//! a tracker. Rather than a second copy of this file or `rmcp` after all, the transport is
//! generic over [`McpService`] — the part that differs between the two is which tools exist
//! and what a call does, and that is the whole trait. What the decision cost: the transport
//! knows nothing about authority, so each service does its own scoping from the request path
//! (the broker reads a per-run token out of it; the ops service accepts one fixed path and
//! nothing else), and the two **never share a listener**. They could have — one accept loop,
//! routed by prefix — and it was not done, because the per-run token path and the operator path
//! would then answer at the same address, which is exactly the address every dispatched worker
//! is handed. Keeping them on separate ports is what makes "crewd never hands a worker the ops
//! tools" a property of the wiring rather than of a prefix check. It does not make them
//! unreachable: a worker inherits the operator's MCP config, and that is accepted (see
//! [`crate::api::mcp`]).
//!
//! ## What the real client does
//!
//! Confirmed by pointing `claude 2.1.278` at a recording server rather than read off a spec,
//! because the parts that would have been guessed wrong are exactly the parts that are not in
//! the spec's happy path:
//!
//! * The first request is **`server/discover`**, not `initialize`, carrying
//!   `mcp-protocol-version: 2026-07-28`. It is not in the revision this server implements, and
//!   answering it with a plain JSON-RPC `-32601` is accepted — the client falls through to the
//!   normal handshake. Nothing here needs to know what it is.
//! * `initialize` then negotiates `2025-11-25`. The server echoes whatever version it is
//!   offered rather than asserting one.
//! * `notifications/initialized` arrives with **no `id`**. A JSON-RPC notification takes no
//!   response body at all: `202 Accepted`, empty. Answering it like a request breaks the
//!   handshake.
//! * The client opens a **`GET` for an SSE stream**. Refusing it with `405` is fine and costs
//!   nothing — this server has no server-initiated messages to push, so a plain
//!   `application/json` response to each POST is the entire transport. That single fact is
//!   what makes this file short enough to be worth owning.
//! * Requests are keep-alive on one connection, so the read loop must serve many requests per
//!   accept rather than closing after the first.
//!
//! ## Exposure
//!
//! The broker's own listener is bound to `127.0.0.1` on an ephemeral port — never a routable
//! interface. Authority there is the per-run token in the path, checked in
//! [`Broker::call`](super::Broker::call). A tool failure is reported as an MCP tool *result*
//! with `isError: true`, never as a JSON-RPC error: the former is something the agent can read
//! and work around, the latter reads as a broken server and is the shape that would turn a
//! refused write into a failed run.
//!
//! The *ops* listener is why [`Limits`] exists. This is a thread per connection, and that
//! address is the operator's to choose: `api.allow_public` can put it on a routable interface,
//! where a client that connects and then says nothing costs a thread for as long as it cares
//! to hold one. The HTTP ops API bounds exactly that with its own `READ_TIMEOUT`; [`Limits`]
//! is the same rule arriving at the other operator surface, and the broker gets it for free.

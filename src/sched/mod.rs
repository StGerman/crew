//! The coordination layer: one tick, one authority, no model in the loop.
//!
//! Tick order is deliberate. Reconciliation runs *first and unconditionally*, so a broken
//! config stops new dispatch without also stranding the runs already in flight. The one piece
//! of reconciliation that sits *behind* the config gate is the parked-issue sweep, because it
//! deletes workspaces on the strength of `is_terminal`, and an overlapping active/terminal
//! config — one of the things preflight rejects — is exactly what would make it delete the
//! workspace of an issue about to be dispatched.
//!
//! Two things are called a gate here and they are unrelated: `Config::preflight` gates
//! *dispatch*, and the handoff gate ([`crate::gate`]) gates a `Done` verdict. `harvest_gates`
//! is the second one's reconciliation step and runs with the rest of reconciliation, ahead of
//! preflight, because a run whose branch is mid-rebase must reach a verdict even under a config
//! typo — otherwise its claim is held for as long as the typo stands.
//!
//! Deviation from the plan: reconciliation lives here rather than in its own module, because
//! it mutates the same `running` map as dispatch and splitting it would mean threading the
//! whole scheduler through a free function for no readability gain.

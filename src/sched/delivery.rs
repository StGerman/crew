//! Delivery: from a run's `Done` to a pull request an operator can merge.
//!
//! `Done` used to mean "the process exited". Every branch that reached `master` in the week
//! this was written took the rest of the path by hand — rebase, gate, push, open the pull
//! request, request review, read the comments, decide, fix, push again — and none of what that
//! path found reached the agent that wrote the code (issue #32). This module walks the part of
//! that path after the branch exists, and it stops at ready-to-merge: there is no merge here,
//! and [`Forge`] has no method for one.
//!
//! ## Shape
//!
//! A `Done` verdict still releases the claim and parks the issue, exactly as before; delivery
//! is then a row in the store advanced by [`Scheduler::advance_deliveries`] on the tick, after
//! reconciliation and before the dispatch gate, at `delivery.poll_interval_ms`. Every step is
//! idempotent — a push of a branch already pushed, an open of a pull request already open — so
//! a transient forge failure costs a poll and nothing else, and a restart resumes from the row.
//!
//! When CI is red, or a review comment is outstanding, the issue is handed back to an agent by
//! the *same* path a `Continue` takes: a retry row due now, a resumed session, and the failure
//! in the prompt as [`Feedback`]. That is the literal form of "a red gate is a `Continue`, never
//! a `Done`": the run said done, and the orchestrator said not yet.
//!
//! ## The runaway this creates, and its brake
//!
//! A reviewer that comments on every push, answered by an agent that pushes a fix, is a loop
//! with no bound of its own — and each turn of it spends a reviewer's quota and an operator's
//! attention as well as tokens. So every hand-back is a *round*, counted against the current
//! pull request and against the issue's whole life, and the per-issue count never resets:
//! not for a new run, not for a new pull request. When either bound is reached the pull request
//! is handed to the operator with the outstanding items named, and nothing more is dispatched
//! for it. The per-issue turn budget is a fourth brake on the same loop and stays in force.
//!
//! ## Verification is not optional
//!
//! A review request is followed by a read. GitHub answers a request for a bot reviewer with
//! `200` and attaches nobody (GETT-174120), so the provider's own answer is not evidence; the
//! pull request's outstanding requests and its posted reviews are. A request that verifiably
//! attached nobody is a handoff with that reason, reported on the issue's row — never a quiet
//! success that leaves a pull request nobody will look at.
//!
//! And it is per head. A fix round pushes a new head to the same pull request, and a reviewer
//! verified against the old one has not seen it; so the push resets `review_requested`, and
//! the request-then-read runs again before the pull request can read as ready (#47).

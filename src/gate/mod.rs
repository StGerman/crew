//! The handoff gate: what stands between an agent saying `Done` and a human being handed the
//! branch.
//!
//! "Agent said done" is not a merge signal. A dispatched run leaves commits on `crew/<key>`
//! green against the base it forked from and unknown against the base it will actually merge
//! into — and the three defects in issue #21 existed only in that combination, where neither
//! agent could have seen them. So a `Done` verdict is not applied until the run's branch has
//! been rebased onto the configured base *and* the gate commands have passed on the rebased
//! tree, in that order, in the agent's own worktree. The rebase has to come first because a
//! gate run against a stale base answers a question nobody asked. A branch that already
//! contains the base's tip is on it and is not rebased: a rebase would drop a merge of the base,
//! and with it the conflict resolution an agent made that way (#122).
//!
//! Like the worker, a gate is a process the scheduler supervises rather than a call it makes:
//! `cargo test` in a real worktree runs for minutes, and a tick that blocked on it would stall
//! stall-detection for every other run. [`Gate::start`] returns a handle the scheduler polls;
//! the claim stays held for as long as the handle is open, so nothing can dispatch a second
//! agent onto a worktree that is mid-rebase.
//!
//! The verdict the scheduler derives from the gate is deliberately three-way. A conflict is a
//! human's problem — the branch is restored to where the agent left it and the issue parks
//! `Blocked` naming the paths — unless every conflicted path is one `gate.agent_resolvable`
//! names ([`agent_resolvable`]), where two branches appending to the same list is mechanical
//! and the agent that wrote one of them resolves it (#111). A failing command is the agent's —
//! the output goes back to it in the continuation prompt and the verdict is `Continue`. And a
//! run of consecutive failures, resolvable conflicts included, escalates to `Blocked`, because
//! a gate that can be failed forever is a runaway with a new name.

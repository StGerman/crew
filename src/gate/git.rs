//! [`Gate`] over real `git rebase` and real subprocesses, in the run's own worktree.
//!
//! One supervising thread per gate, the same shape as the real worker: the scheduler polls a
//! handle, and the thread does the blocking. Commands are exec'd directly — argv, no shell —
//! for the reason the worker never uses `bash -lc`: a shell re-imports the operator's dotfiles,
//! and a gate command is the one subprocess here that inherits the operator's environment, so it
//! is also the one that must not be handed a shell to widen that further. A command that needs a
//! pipe belongs in a script the repository checks in.
//!
//! The environment *is* inherited, unlike the worker's allowlist: this is the operator's own
//! test suite running in the operator's own repository with no agent involved, and `cargo`
//! needs `PATH`, `CARGO_HOME`, `RUSTUP_HOME` and whatever else the machine's toolchain relies on.
//! Colour is switched off because the output's destination is a prompt, not a terminal.

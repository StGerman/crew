//! `crewd init`: register this operator's own GitHub App through the Manifest flow (#65).
//!
//! Every operator registers their own App because the private key belongs to whoever owns it, and
//! a self-hosted daemon has to hold that key to mint tokens; there is no one App to ship. What this
//! module decides is only how much of that is the human's work: two clicks — *Create* on GitHub's
//! manifest page, *Install* on the App's — and nothing typed. The page, the listener and the four
//! GitHub calls are in the submodules; this file is the order they happen in and the files they
//! leave.
//!
//! The order is what makes a failure recoverable. The key is written the moment the conversion
//! returns it, before anything else can fail, because the code that produced it is single-use:
//! a key held only in memory across the install wait is a key a Ctrl-C throws away along with the
//! App it belongs to. The settings file is written last, and only with an installation id read
//! back over the App's own JWT, so a file that exists is a file #64's `tracker.github_app` can use.
//!
//! Output is `<dir>/github-app.toml` (`app_id`, `installation_id`, `private_key_path`) and
//! `<dir>/github-app.pem` at mode 600, in a directory at mode 700. `init` never edits the daemon's
//! config — that names the settings file with one line — and never overwrites either file, so
//! re-running it is safe and a second App is a deliberate act.
//!
//! This is not the only path: `GITHUB_TOKEN` and a hand-registered App written into the same
//! settings file are untouched by it.

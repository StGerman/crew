<!--
Title: one sentence naming the outcome. Restate it as the first line of Why.
File with no milestone and no `agent` label. The issue-triage skill places it,
and appends a Decisions section when it settles something; do not write one.
Delete every HTML comment before filing: a comment left here is part of the body,
and the body is the only text a dispatched agent sees (until #157 strips them).
More than 3 acceptance criteria usually means two issues.
-->

## Why

<!-- The outcome, then what we want to be true and why the work is worth doing. -->

## What

<!-- The work that should reach the outcome. -->

**Boundary:** <!-- trait implementation | external command | hook | core change, because <reason>. A core change names the invariant row in docs/invariants.md it adds or protects, or says why it needs none. -->

**Out of scope:** <!-- What must not change. Write `none` if nothing is fenced off. -->

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] <!-- Guard test named as a sentence: `a_thing_holds_under_the_condition`. Must fail on the base commit. Behavior-preserving changes name existing tests that must stay green. -->

## Open

<!-- A decision this issue still needs. Delete this section when nothing is undecided; triage won't dispatch while it has content. -->

## Triggered by

<!-- What someone was doing when this came up, and the date. -->

//! `crewctl`: ask a running `crewd` what it is doing, over the ops API it publishes (#45).
//!
//! A separate binary so that "the client cannot touch the daemon's store" is a fact about the
//! dependency graph rather than an early `return` someone has to remember to keep: this crate
//! links `libcrew` and nothing that can open SQLite, a worktree or a tracker credential. An
//! operator asking what is running must not be able to disturb it, and a second process on the
//! daemon's database would be exactly that. CI checks the graph with `cargo tree`.

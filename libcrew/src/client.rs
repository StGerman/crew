//! The other end of `crewd`'s ops API, behind `crewctl status`.
//!
//! The API landed before this did, and in the window between the two it was not reached for
//! once — diagnosing a live run meant tailing a block-buffered log file hours behind the
//! daemon, which produced a wrong answer. `curl` would have been right and instant. Nobody
//! typed it because there was nothing to type: a port to remember and a `jq` filter to write
//! is enough friction to send an operator back to the logs. So this is deliberately a client
//! and nothing more — no new server surface, and no second way to reach the scheduler.
//!
//! Two properties it inherits rather than re-decides:
//!
//! * **It reads the published API only.** No `Store`, no `~/.claude/tasks`, no git. The same
//!   rule that keeps the TUI from becoming load-bearing, for the same reason — and the same
//!   consequence, which is that a question this cannot answer is a missing `Snapshot` field
//!   rather than a reason to open the database here. [`crate::Row::branch`] was added
//!   under exactly that rule.
//! * **It shares the wire types with the server.** [`Snapshot`] and [`Row`] are serialised by
//!   one and deserialised by the other, so a field renamed on the scheduler breaks this at
//!   compile time instead of silently rendering a blank column.
//!
//! What this module owns beyond the request is the part an operator actually feels: finding
//! the daemon without being told where it is ([`endpoint`]), and saying something useful when
//! it is not there ([`StatusError`]).
